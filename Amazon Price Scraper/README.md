# Amazon Price Scraper

This was a group project I worked on with 2 other teammates for S E 186X, an experimental learning community class where we could choose our own project/language and simply work on it until the end of the semester.

We wanted to learn the fundamentals of HTML retrieval and parsing, so we put together a program that could take Amazon item IDs, automatically find the price element on the page, then check the page repeatedly looking for a sale.
