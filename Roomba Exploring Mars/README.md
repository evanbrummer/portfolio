# Roomba Embedded Controller

This was a group project I worked on with 3 other teammates for CPR E 288, intro to embedded systems. Our theme was that our Roomba was exploring Mars, avoiding alien tunnels and monoliths using its IR and ping sensors until it reached its destination.

This was a fantastic experience, and I learned a ton about microcontrollers, register control, bitwise operations and wireless communication with PuTTY.
