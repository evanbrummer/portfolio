# Card Games (for u & me)

This was a group project I worked on with 4 other teammates for my very first programming class: S E 185, introduction to C.

Being beginner programmers, we all just worked on the parts we were comfortable with. I did the majority of bug fixing and final touches for score tracking and sorting.
