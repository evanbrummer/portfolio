			<h2>Solitaire</h2>
			<p>
				Release and play into position certain cards to build up each 
				foundation, in sequence and in suit, from the ace through the 
				king. The ultimate objective is to build the whole pack onto 
				the foundations, and if that can be done, the game is won.
			</p>

			<h2>War</h2>
			<p>
				Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player 
				with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, 
				on the bottom of his stack.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns 
				up one card face down and one card face up. The player with
				the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). 
				The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

			<h2>Crazy Eights</h2>
			<p>
				Each card played (other than an eight) must match the card 
				showing on the starter pile, either in suit or in denomination. 
				If unable to play, cards are drawn. A player may draw a card 
				even if they have a playable card in their hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				All eights are wild(!) and may be played at any time in turn, 
				and the player must specify a suit for it (but never a number).
