# Senior Design Project Manager

This was my senior design project that I worked on with 4 other teammates for S E 491/492, senior design. The goal of our project was to create an all-in-one web application to manage senior design projects for the ECpE Department. We inherited parts of the React frontend from a previous team and hacked out the Spring Boot backend after ditching the first attempt in Laravel.

We learned a lot along the way. I really enjoyed being able to work all over the development stack for this project.

### Some of the things I worked on

#### React Frontend
- [App.js]()
- [NavBar.js]()
- [Dashboard.js]()
- [UserContext.js]()

#### Spring Boot Backend
- [UserController.java]()
- [UserEntity.java]()
