# Flockd

This was a group project I worked on with 3 other teammates for S E 309, software development practices. We developed a game-oriented dating app, where users would be matched based on their stats in a Flappy Bird-style game.

Throughout this project, I became very familiar with Android Studio, Gradle, the Volley REST library, WebSockets and testing with Espresso.
