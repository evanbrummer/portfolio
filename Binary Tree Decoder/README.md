# Binary Tree Decoder

Our final assignment for COM S 227, intro to data structures and algorithms, was to write a message reconstructor that read a string to create a character tree, and then read a string of 0s and 1s to traverse the tree and generate the message. See [Example Output](), generated from [monalisa.arch]().

### My code: 

- [MsgReconstructor.java]()
- [MsgTree.java]()
