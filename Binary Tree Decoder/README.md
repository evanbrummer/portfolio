# Binary Tree Decoder

Our final assignment for COM S 227, intro to data structures and algorithms, was to write a message reconstructor that read a string to create a character tree, and then read a string of 0s and 1s to traverse the tree and generate the message. See [Example Output](https://github.com/evanbrummer/portfolio/blob/main/Binary%20Tree%20Decoder/Example%20Output.txt), generated from [monalisa.arch](https://github.com/evanbrummer/portfolio/blob/main/Binary%20Tree%20Decoder/monalisa.arch).
